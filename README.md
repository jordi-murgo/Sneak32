## üïµÔ∏è‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Overview

Sneak32 is an advanced WiFi and Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) scanning and detection tool built on the ESP32 platform. It offers powerful capabilities for network analysis, device tracking, and security research.

## üéØ Application in Infiltrator Detection

Sneak32 is ideal for detecting devices that may be associated with surveillance or infiltration in social movements or sensitive environments. The tool allows you to capture WiFi and BLE device data in one location (RECON phase) and then analyze connections in your secure space (DETECTION phase) to identify suspicious presences.

## üîç Operation Modes

- **RECON Phase:**
  - Captures SSIDs (from Beacons and Probe Requests), WiFi client MAC addresses, and BLE device advertisements in hostile or unsecured terrains.
  - Ideal for collecting data without drawing attention (passive and stealth modes).
  - Captures WiFi management, control, and data frames.
  - Configurable to focus on management frames only.
  - BLE scanning can be passive or active depending on the mode.
  - In Stealth mode, the device doesn't advertise itself via BLE until it detects a preconfigured device name in BLE advertisements.

- **DETECTION Phase:**
  - Once data is collected in the RECON phase, Sneak32 can be used in your secure space to monitor for the presence of suspicious devices, identified by their WiFi/BLE MAC addresses or by the SSIDs in their WiFi probe requests.
  - Uses passive scans for discreet monitoring.
  - In active mode, periodically broadcasts all prohibited SSIDs to force visibility of devices that might attempt to connect, even if they haven't emitted a Probe Request.

## üöÄ Features

## ‚öîÔ∏è Usage Strategies in Sensitive Environments

- **Public Environment Monitoring**: Install Sneak32 in public meeting places to capture data from unknown devices and analyze connection patterns.
- **Social Movement Protection**: Use Sneak32 to detect devices attempting to connect to known networks or making suspicious probe requests, helping to identify potential infiltrators.
- **Research Applications**: Sneak32 allows security researchers to collect device data without being detected, thanks to its passive mode.

## üï∂Ô∏è Operating Modes

- **Passive Mode**: Does not perform active scans or announce networks, simply listens to communications without being detected.
- **Active Mode**: Announces fake networks (SSIDs) to entice devices to connect, or performs "active scans" to obtain information from nearby BLE devices.
