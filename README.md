# Sneak32 - ESP32-based WiFi & BLE Scanner and Detector

## üïµÔ∏è‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Overview

Sneak32 is an advanced WiFi and Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) scanning and detection tool built on the ESP32 platform. It offers powerful capabilities for network analysis, device tracking, and security research.

## üöÄ Features

- **Dual-Mode Operation:**
  - Scan Mode: Continuously scans for WiFi networks, devices, and BLE devices.
  - Detection Mode: Monitors for specific WiFi networks or devices.

- **WiFi Capabilities:**
  - Detects WiFi networks (SSIDs) and connected devices.
  - Captures management, control, and data frames.
  - Configurable to focus on management frames only.
  - Detects WiFi devices based on MAC address.

- **BLE Capabilities:**
  - Scans for nearby BLE devices.
  - Option to ignore random BLE addresses.
  - Detects specific BLE devices.

- **Customizable Settings:**
  - Adjustable scan intervals for WiFi and BLE.
  - Configurable RSSI threshold for signal filtering.
  - Passive scan option.
  - Stealth mode to minimize detectability.
  - Device name configuration based on chip model and MAC address.

- **Data Management:**
  - JSON data output for easy parsing and analysis.
  - Option to save all data or only relevant data.
  - Configurable autosave interval.
  - Flash storage for data persistence.

- **User Interface:**
  - Web-based interface (HTML/JavaScript) for configuration and data retrieval.
  - Real-time status updates.
  - Event logging for monitoring device activities.
  - Bluetooth LE connection with specific characteristics for commands, data transfer, and settings.

## üõ† Hardware Requirements

- ESP32 development board (tested on ESP32-C3)
- (Optional) NeoPixel LED for status indication
- (Optional) Button for reset or additional functions

## üìö Software Dependencies

- Arduino core for ESP32
- ESP32 BLE library
- WiFi library
- FreeRTOS
- (Optional) Adafruit NeoPixel library

## üîß Setup and Configuration

1. **Clone the repository:**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/jordi-murgo/Sneak32.git
```

2. **Install necessary dependencies** through Arduino IDE's Library Manager or PlatformIO.

3. **Compile and flash** the firmware to your ESP32 device.

4. **Power on the device** and verify that the LED (if connected) indicates the correct status.

5. **Connect to the device via Bluetooth LE:**
   - Use the provided web interface in `docs/index.html`.
   - Open the `index.html` file in a compatible browser (Chrome or Edge recommended).
   - The default `index.html` are also deployed and available at [https://jordi-murgo.github.io/Sneak32](https://jordi-murgo.github.io/Sneak32)
   - Click "Search for Device" and select your Sneak32 device.

6. **Configure device options** through the interface:
   - Device name
   - Operation mode
   - Scan intervals and durations
   - Thresholds and filters

7. **Start scanning** and monitoring using the interface options.

## üìä Data Output

Sneak32 provides detailed JSON output including:

- **Detected WiFi networks:**
  - SSIDs, channels, signal strength, network type, times seen, last seen time.

- **WiFi devices:**
  - MAC addresses, signal strength, channel, times seen, last seen time.

- **BLE devices:**
  - Names (if available), MAC addresses, public/private status, signal strength, times seen, last seen time.

- **Example format:**
  ```json
  {
    "wifi_networks": [
      {
        "ssid": "MyWiFiNetwork",
        "rssi": -45,
        "channel": 6,
        "type": "beacon",
        "times_seen": 5,
        "last_seen": 1627845600
      }
    ],
    "wifi_devices": [
      {
        "mac_address": "A4:B1:C1:D1:E1:F1",
        "rssi": -50,
