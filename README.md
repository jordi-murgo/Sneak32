## ü•∑ Overview

Sneak32 is an advanced WiFi and Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) scanning and detection tool built on the ESP32 platform. It offers powerful capabilities for network analysis, device tracking, and security research.

## üéØ Application in Infiltrator Detection

Sneak32 is ideal for detecting devices that may be associated with surveillance or infiltration in social movements or sensitive environments. The tool allows you to capture WiFi and BLE device data in one location (RECON phase) and then analyze connections in your secure space (DEFENSE phase) to identify suspicious presences.

## üîç Modes of Operation

### Core Operation Phases

#### 1. RECON Phase
- **Purpose:** Capture and collect data in potentially hostile or unsecured environments
- **Capabilities:**
  - Captures WiFi data:
    - SSIDs from Beacons and Probe Requests
    - Client MAC addresses
    - Management, control, and data frames
  - Captures BLE device advertisements
- **Scanning Modes:**
  - **Passive Scan:** 
    - WiFi: Only listens for beacons and probe requests
    - BLE: Only listens for advertisements
    - No active requests sent
  - **Active Scan:**
    - WiFi: Sends probe requests to discover hidden networks
    - BLE: Performs active scanning
    - Maximizes data collection but increases visibility
  - **Stealth Mode:** 
    - Complete radio silence except for essential operations
    - No response to BLE scans (except last paired device)
    - Minimal RF footprint for maximum concealment

#### 2. DEFENSE Phase
- **Purpose:** Monitor secure spaces for previously identified suspicious devices
- **Capabilities:**
  - Monitors for specific WiFi/BLE MAC addresses
  - Detects devices based on their WiFi probe requests
  - Can force device visibility through SSID broadcasting
- **Operation Modes:**
  - **Passive Defense:**
    - Silent monitoring of all communications
    - No active scanning or broadcasting
    - Pure listening mode for maximum stealth
  - **Active Defense:**
    - Broadcasts known suspicious SSIDs to trigger auto-connect attempts
    - Performs active BLE scanning to detect target devices
    - Forces suspicious devices to reveal themselves
  - **Stealth Mode:**
    - Complete radio silence except for essential operations
    - No response to BLE scans (except last paired device)
    - Pure passive monitoring

### Mode Selection Guide

Choose your operation mode based on:
1. **Mission Phase:**
   - RECON: For initial data gathering in hostile environments
   - DEFENSE: For monitoring secure spaces
   
2. **Stealth Requirements:**
   - **Stealth Mode:** When absolute concealment is critical
     - No BLE responses (except to last paired device)
     - Minimal RF emissions
     - Maximum concealment
   
3. **Scanning Intensity:**
   - **Passive:** When stealth is important but full radio silence isn't required
     - No active requests
     - Only listens for broadcasts
   - **Active:** When maximum data collection is priority
     - Sends probe/scan requests
     - Broadcasts known SSIDs (in DEFENSE)
     - Higher chance of detection

4. **Risk vs Data Collection:**
   - Higher scanning intensity = More data but increased detection risk
   - Lower scanning intensity = Less data but better concealment

## üöÄ Features
