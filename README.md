### Task Communication

Tasks communicate using FreeRTOS primitives to ensure thread safety and efficient data exchange:

1. **Message Queues**:
   - `wifiPacketQueue`: Transfers WiFi packet data (capacity: 50 messages)
   - `bleDeviceQueue`: Transfers BLE device information (capacity: 50 messages)
   - `commandQueue`: Handles command and control messages (capacity: 10 messages)

2. **Mutex Semaphores**:
   - `wifiListMutex`: Protects access to WiFi device and network lists
   - `bleListMutex`: Protects access to BLE device list
   - `flashMutex`: Ensures atomic access to flash storage operations

3. **Message Structures**:
   - `WifiPacketMessage`: Contains WiFi packet data, RSSI, channel, and frame type
   - `BLEDeviceMessage`: Contains BLE device address, name, RSSI, and advertisement data
   - `CommandMessage`: Contains command codes and parameters for system control

### Memory Management

The system employs a dynamic memory allocation strategy based on available resources:

1. **PSRAM Utilization**:
   - Automatically detects and utilizes PSRAM if available
   - Adjusts list capacities based on memory availability:
     - With PSRAM: 255 WiFi stations, 200 networks, 100 BLE devices
     - Without PSRAM: 100 WiFi stations, 50 networks, 50 BLE devices

2. **Custom Allocators**:
   - Uses `DynamicPsramAllocator` for PSRAM-aware memory allocation
   - Ensures efficient memory usage for device lists

3. **Stack Sizing**:
   - Task stacks are sized according to their processing requirements
   - Device Management Task has larger stack (8192 bytes) for handling complex list operations

### Task Priorities

Tasks are assigned priorities based on their real-time requirements:

| Task                 | Priority | Stack Size | Core Affinity |
|----------------------|----------|------------|---------------|
| WiFi Scan Task       | 5        | 4096       | PRO_CPU (0)   |
| BLE Scan Task        | 4        | 4096       | PRO_CPU (0)   |
| Device Management    | 3        | 8192       | APP_CPU (1)   |
| Data Processing      | 2        | 4096       | APP_CPU (1)   |
| BLE Service          | 2        | 4096       | APP_CPU (1)   |
| Status Updates       | 1        | 2048       | APP_CPU (1)   |

## üì° BLE Communication

Sneak32 utilizes Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) for wireless communication with client applications. The BLE implementation follows a service-characteristic model that allows for efficient data exchange and device control.

### Service UUID

Sneak32 exposes a single primary service with the following UUID:

| Service Name | UUID                                 | Description                      |
|--------------|--------------------------------------|----------------------------------|
| Sneak32      | `81af4cd7-e091-490a-99ee-caa99032ef4e` | Main service for all functionality |

### Characteristic UUIDs

Within the main service, Sneak32 provides several characteristics for different functions:

| Characteristic Name | UUID    | Properties       | Description                                          |
|---------------------|---------|------------------|------------------------------------------------------|
| Firmware Info       | `0xFFE3` | Read             | Provides firmware version and device information     |
| Settings            | `0xFFE2` | Read, Write      | Allows reading and modifying device settings         |
| Data Transfer       | `0xFFE0` | Notify, Write, Indicate | Used for transferring scan data to client applications |
| Commands            | `0xFFE4` | Write            | Receives commands from client applications           |
| Status              | `0xFFE1` | Read, Notify     | Provides real-time status updates                    |
| Response            | `0xFFE5` | Read, Notify     | Returns responses to commands                        |

### BLE Data Protocol

Sneak32 uses a simple protocol for BLE communication:

1. **Commands**: Client applications can send text commands to the Commands characteristic (0xFFE4). Supported commands include:
   - `VERSION`: Returns firmware version information
   - `SCAN_START`: Starts BLE scanning
   - `SCAN_STOP`: Stops BLE scanning
   - `SET_NAME:[name]`: Changes the device name

2. **Responses**: After processing a command, Sneak32 sends a response through the Response characteristic (0xFFE5).

3. **Data Transfer**: Scan results are sent through the Data Transfer characteristic (0xFFE0) in JSON format. The data includes:
   - WiFi networks (SSIDs)
   - WiFi devices (stations)
   - BLE devices

4. **Status Updates**: The Status characteristic (0xFFE1) provides real-time updates about the device's operation state.

This priority scheme ensures that time-sensitive operations (packet capture) take precedence over background processing and UI updates.

### Watchdog Protection

The system implements task watchdog timers to prevent system lockups:

1. **Task Watchdog Timer (TWDT)**:
   - Monitors task execution and detects if tasks are stuck
   - Generates diagnostic information (core dumps) on failure
   - Helps identify and resolve potential deadlocks or infinite loops

2. **Defensive Programming**:
   - All tasks implement proper error handling and recovery mechanisms
   - Critical sections are protected with timeouts to prevent deadlocks
   - Resource initialization is verified before use
