## üïµÔ∏è‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Overview

Sneak32 is an advanced WiFi and Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) scanning and detection tool built on the ESP32 platform. It offers powerful capabilities for network analysis, device tracking, and security research.

## üéØ Application in Infiltrator Detection

Sneak32 is ideal for detecting devices that may be associated with surveillance or infiltration in social movements or sensitive environments. The tool allows you to capture WiFi and BLE device data in one location (RECON phase) and then analyze connections in your secure space (DETECTION phase) to identify suspicious presences.

## üîç Operation Modes

- **RECON Phase:**
  - Captures SSIDs (from Beacons and Probe Requests), WiFi client MAC addresses, and BLE device advertisements in hostile or unsecured terrains.
  - Ideal for collecting data without drawing attention (passive and stealth modes).
  - Captures WiFi management, control, and data frames.
  - Configurable to focus on management frames only.
  - BLE scanning can be passive or active depending on the mode.
  - In Stealth mode, the device doesn't advertise itself via BLE until it detects a preconfigured device name in BLE advertisements.

- **DETECTION Phase:**
  - Once data is collected in the RECON phase, Sneak32 can be used in your secure space to monitor for the presence of suspicious devices, identified by their WiFi/BLE MAC addresses or by the SSIDs in their WiFi probe requests.
  - Uses passive scans for discreet monitoring.
  - In active mode, periodically broadcasts all prohibited SSIDs to force visibility of devices that might attempt to connect, even if they haven't emitted a Probe Request.

## üöÄ Features

- **Dual-Mode Operation:**
  - Scan Mode: Continuously scans for WiFi networks, devices, and BLE devices.
  - Detection Mode: Monitors for specific WiFi networks or devices.

- **WiFi Capabilities:**
  - Detects WiFi networks (SSIDs) and connected devices.
  - Captures management, control, and data frames.
  - Configurable to focus on management frames only.
  - Detects WiFi devices based on MAC address.

- **BLE Capabilities:**
  - Scans for nearby BLE devices.
  - Option to ignore random BLE addresses.
  - Detects specific BLE devices.

- **Customizable Settings:**
  - Adjustable scan intervals for WiFi and BLE.
  - Configurable RSSI threshold for signal filtering.
  - Passive scan option.
  - Stealth mode to minimize detectability.
  - Device name configuration based on chip model and MAC address.

- **Data Management:**
  - JSON data output for easy parsing and analysis.
  - Option to save all data or only relevant data.
  - Configurable autosave interval.
  - Flash storage for data persistence.

- **User Interface:**
  - Web-based interface (HTML/JavaScript) for configuration and data retrieval.
  - Real-time status updates.
  - Event logging for monitoring device activities.
  - Bluetooth LE connection with specific characteristics for commands, data transfer, and settings.

## üíª Hardware and Software Compatibility

Sneak32 has been tested with the **ESP32-C3** board, a low-cost RISC-V microcontroller (less than $3), which offers:

- WiFi 802.11 b/g/n (2.4 GHz) and Bluetooth 5.0 LE.
- 4MB Flash memory and 400KB SRAM.
- Support for **Arduino IDE**, **PlatformIO**, and **Espressif IDF**, facilitating programming and customization of the device according to each project's needs.

## üñ•Ô∏è Hardware Requirements

- ESP32 development board (recommended: ESP32-C3-SuperMini or other ESP32 variants with PCB antenna or external antenna)
- (Optional) RGB LED for visual status indication
- (Optional) Battery for portable operation

![ESP32-C3-SuperMini](images/esp32-c3-supermini.png)

The ESP32-C3-SuperMini is a good choice for this project due to its compact size, low cost, and low power consumption. However, it's important to note that this model uses a ceramic chip antenna, which may limit its range and data capture capabilities compared to models with PCB antennas or external antennas.

For optimal performance and range:

- Consider ESP32 variants with PCB antennas or external antenna connectors.
- Models with external antennas generally offer the best range and data capture capabilities.

Other ESP32 variants are compatible with the program by specifying the appropriate board in the `platformio.ini` file.

### Antenna Considerations

1. **Ceramic Chip Antenna (e.g., ESP32-C3-SuperMini):**
   - Pros: Compact, low cost
   - Cons: Limited range, may capture fewer data points

2. **PCB Antenna:**
   - Pros: Better range than ceramic chip antennas, still relatively compact
   - Cons: May not match the range of external antennas

3. **External Antenna:**
   - Pros: Best range and data capture capabilities
   - Cons: Larger form factor, may require additional components

Choose the antenna type based on your specific needs for range, data capture, and form factor.

## ‚öîÔ∏è Usage Strategies in Sensitive Environments

- **Public Environment Monitoring**: Install Sneak32 in public meeting places to capture data from unknown devices and analyze connection patterns.
- **Social Movement Protection**: Use Sneak32 to detect devices attempting to connect to known networks or making suspicious probe requests, helping to identify potential infiltrators.
- **Research Applications**: Sneak32 allows security researchers to collect device data without being detected, thanks to its passive mode.

## üï∂Ô∏è Operating Modes

- **Passive Mode**: Does not perform active scans or announce networks, simply listens to communications without being detected.
- **Active Mode**: Announces fake networks (SSIDs) to entice devices to connect, or performs "active scans" to obtain information from nearby BLE devices.
